# INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE

This app has been developed in direct response to the current events happening in the United States in Spring of 2020.  This is my declaration that Black Lives Matter.  I am hoping that this app will be used for an event in Denver, CO in Summer of 2020 in conjuction with RedLine Contemporary Art Gallerr's Summer Block Party (theme: AFROFUTURISM).  It is our hope that we can use this app as a tool for members of our community who are ready to acknowledge our priveledge as white citizens and to take a stand against racism, in ALL of it's forms.  EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL!
